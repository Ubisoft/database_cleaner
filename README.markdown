Dear maintainer,
 
I am part of Ubisoft Open Source committee and I am contacting you regarding the GitHub organization:https://github.com/ubisoft

Ubisoft company is a big believer and user of Open Source technologies. As such we have recently launched our own Open Source initiative. We would like to retrieve the “ubisoft” organization on GitHub to allow us to publish and contribute to the Open Source community. Could you please reach out to me so that we could discuss the details of this operation?

Many thanks in advance for your understanding.


Best,


Alexis ROLLAND
